# detect-eye-state
A deep learning model to detect state of eye (open/close) in image/video


### About the model
The model was trained on [this][1] dataset of closed and open eyes.

To predict for a video use function `predict_on_video` and to predict for an image use `predict_on_image` in the [Jupyter notebook](Detect%20EyeState.ipynb).

### Demo
Below is a sample prediction for the ["Coca-Cola | Eyes Closed"][2] video by Coca-Cola.
The prediction of the model (`open` or `close`) is shown in green in the top-left of video, with the confidence in parenthesis.

### Downside of the model
The model is trained only to detect open and closed eyes. Hence it gives a closed eye prediction when the image/video frame does not have a face.
